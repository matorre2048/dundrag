#### Barbarian Class Features
###### Level 1: Rage
You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren't wearing Heavy armor.
You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
While active, your rage follows the rules below
- ***Damage Resistance.*** You have resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.
- ***Rage Damage.*** When you make an attack using Strength-with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike-and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.
- ***Strength Advantage.*** You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. 
- ***No Concentration or Spells.*** You can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells.
- ***Duration.*** The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:
	- Make an attack roll against an enemy.
	- Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
	- Take a Bonus Action to extend your rage.
Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.
###### Level 1: Unarmored Defense
While you aren't wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.
###### Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes or Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.
When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian Features table.
###### Level 2: Danger Sense
You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.
###### Level 2: Reckless Attack
You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time.
###### Level 3: Barbarian Subclass
You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The Path of the Berserker, Path of the Wild Heart, Path of the World Tree, and Path of the Zealot subclasses are detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Barbarian level or lower.
###### Level 3: Primal Knowledge
You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.
In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. When you use the ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.
###### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.
###### Level 5: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
###### Level 5: Fast Movement
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy armor.
###### Level 7: Feral Instinct
Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls.
###### Level 7: Instinctive Pounce
As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.
###### Level 9: Brutal Strike
If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn't have Dsadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an exxtra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options.
Forceful Blow. The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks.
Hamstring Blow. The target's Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time- the most recent one.



# Barbarian Subclasses

## Path of the Berserker
*Channel Rage into Violent Fury*
![Path of the Berserker.png](/img/user/Config/DATA/Image%20Storage/Path%20of%20the%20Berserker.png)
Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize and empower them. 
###### Level 3: Frenzy
If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage damage bonus, and add them together. The damage has the same type as the weapon or Unarmed Strike used for the attack.

## Path of the Wild Heart
*Walk in Community with the Animal World*
![Path of the Wild Heart.png](/img/user/Config/DATA/Image%20Storage/Path%20of%20the%20Wild%20Heart.png)
Barbarians who follow the Path of the Wild Heart view themselves as kin to animals. These Barbarians learn magical means to communicate with animals, and their Rage heightens their connection to animals as it fills them with supernatural might.
#### Level 3: Animal Speaker
You can cast the *Beast Sense* and *Speak with Animals* spells but only as Rituals. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them.
#### Level 3: Rage of the Wilds
Your Rage taps into the primal power of animals. Whenever you activate your Rage, you gain one of the following options of your choice.
- ***Bear.*** While your Rage is active, you have resistance to every damage type except Force, Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant.
- ***Eagle.*** When you activate your Rage, you can take the Disengage and Dash actions as part of that Bonus Action. While your Rage is active, you can take a Bonus Action to take both of those actions.
- ***Wolf.*** While your Rage is active your allies have Advantage on attack rolls against any enemy of yours within 5 feet of you.

## Path of the World Tree
*Trace the Roots and Branches of the Multiverse*
![Path of the World Tree.png](/img/user/Config/DATA/Image%20Storage/Path%20of%20the%20World%20Tree.png)
Barbarians who follow the Path of the World Tree connect with the cosmic tree Yggdrasil through their Rage. This tree grows among the Outer Plains, connecting them to each other and the Material Plane. These Barbarians draw on the tree's magic for vitality and as a means of dimensional travel.
#### Level 3. Vitality of the Tree
Your Rage taps into the life force of the World Tree. You gain the following benefits.
- *Vitality Surge.* When you activate your Rage, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Barbarian level.
- *Life-Giving Force.* At the start of each of your turns while your Rage is active, you can choose another creature within 10 feet of yourself to gain Temporary Hit Points. To determine the number of Temporary Hit Points, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. If any of these Temporary Hit Points remain when your rage ends, they vanish. 
#### Level 6. Branches of the Tree
Whenever a creature you can see starts its turn within 30 feet of you while your Rage is active, you can take a Reaction to summon spectral branches of the World Tree around it. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or be teleported to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of yourself or in the nearest unoccupied space you can see. After the target teleports, you can reduce its Speed to 0 until the end of the current turn.
#### Level 10. Battering Roots
During your turn, your reach is 10 feet greater with any Melee weapon that has the Heavy or Versatile property, as tendrils of the World Tree extend from you. When you hit with such a weapon on your turn, you can activate the Push or Topple mastery property in addition to a different mastery property you're using with that weapon. 
#### Level 14. Travel Along the Tree
When you activate your Rage and as a Bonus Action while your Rage is active, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. 
In addition, once per Rage, you can increase the range of that teleport to 150 feet. When you do so, you can also bring up to six willing creatures who are within 10 feet of you. Each creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 10 feet of your destination space.
