Druid Class Features


Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells through the studying the mystical forces of nature. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear in the Druid spell list later in the class's description.
- ***Cantrips.*** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. *Druidcraft* and *Produce Flame* are recommended.
  
  Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Druid cantrip of your choice. 
  
  When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another Druid cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.
- ***Spell Slots.*** The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.
- ***Prepared Spells of Level 1+***. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. *[[Character Creation/Spells/Spells#Animal Friendship\|Spells#Animal Friendship]]*, *Cure Wounds,* *Faerie Fire,* and *Thunderwave* are recommended.

  The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Druid spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Druid Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six Druid spells of level 1 and 2 in any combination.

  If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you. 
  
- Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.
- ***Spellcasting Ability.*** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.
- ***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use an Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.
Level 1: Druidic
You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the *Speak with Animals* spell prepared.

You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can't decipher it without magic.
Level 1: Primal Order
You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.
- ***Magician.*** You know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1).
- ***Warden.*** Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor.
Level 2: Wild Shape
The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see "Known Forms" below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.
- ***Number of Uses.*** You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
  
  You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.
- ***Known Forms.*** You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed. The rat, Riding Horse, Spider, and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.
  
  When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.
  
  When choosing known forms, you may look in the *Monster Manual* or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.


- ***Rules While Shape-Shifted.*** While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:
	- **Temporary Hit Points.** When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.
	- **Game Statistics.** Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher than yours, use one in the stat block.
	- **No Spellcasting.** You can't cast spells, but shapeshifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with spells you've already cast.
	- **Objects.** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment fall in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.
Level 2: Wild Companion
You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the *Find Familiar* spell without Material components.

When you cast the spell this way, the familiar is Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.
