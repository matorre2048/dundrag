You are a survivor, you have endured in circumstances where others have perished. The experience you survived may have been a natural, supernatural, magical disaster, the rampage of some kind of monster or violent prejudice. You may be haunted by your experiences or roused to action by them. Either way, your past trauma is part of you and has driven you to adventure.
