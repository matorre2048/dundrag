This section outlines services and other expenses that adventurers might spend money on.
# Lifestyle Expenses
Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment maintenance, and other necessities.

At the start of each week or month (DM's choice), choose a lifestyle below--Wretched, Squalid, Poor, Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic--and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.

Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the DM might take them into account when determining risks or how others perceive your character.
## Wretched (Free)
You survive via chance and charity. You're often exposed to natural dangers as a result of sleeping outside.
## Squalid (1 SP per Day)
You spend the bare minimum for your necessities. You might be exposed to unhealthy conditions and opportunistic criminals.
## Poor (2 SP per Day)
You spend frugally for your necessities.
## Modest (1 GP per Day)
You support yourself at an average level.
## Comfortable (2 GP per Day)
You spend modestly for your necessities and enjoy a few luxuries.
## Wealthy (4 GP per Day)
You're accustomed to the finer things in life and might have servants.
## Aristocratic (10 GP per Day)
You pay for the best and might have a staff that supports yourself lifestyle. Others notice your wealth and might encourage you to share it, either legally or otherwise.
