## Backstory
Früt had a happy childhood for the most part. She always felt safe, included, and excited by life in the horde. Her parents were Hilde and Braug, though she felt as if she had a hundred fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers in the horde.

She spent most of her early life in the great outdoors, moving from place to place, chasing resources and the thrill of battle. The great wide world provided if one knew where to look. From the moss lining forest floors that helped staunch seeping wounds to the plentiful berries that popped up in summer as a sweet treat, the natural world was as much a caregiver as Früt's parents.

From the time she could hold herself upright, Früt could hold an axe. It was a familiar game to run around with the other children and play as warriors. She would return from the wilds at supper with the miniature-sized horde of children covered in mud and blood but with beaming smiles, just as she had seen the older folks return after their real battles. There was nothing so purifying as a day spent screaming and fighting.

Früt provided for the horde just as the horde provided for her, so when the sickness came just as she came of age, she knew that she would do her utmost to preserve the horde. People around her coughed and vomited and moaned and wept at the pain, and the elders, whose knowledge in medicine was deepest, were the first to succumb. She was instructed by her mother and others to go into [[Campaign/Encyclopedia/Locations/Tsobu Forest\|Tsobu Forest]] to search for healing herbs with [[Campaign/Player Characters/Unity's Character\|Unity's character (UC)]]. While she knew from passing through other villages that many saw Tsobu as mysterious and even dangerous, Früt always felt an ease there. Not that she didn't respect its sacredness, but that she saw herself as part of the whole of the world, and in that both Tsobu and she existed. She and UC traversed the forest for a number of days, gathering what they could, casting a wide net for what they thought would be helpful. UC had a natural talent for healing and Früt trusted in her ability to save the horde, now that they were some of the only healthy ones remaining. On the final night, Früt had a dream of the Great Tortoise lying in a pool of glittering starlight, and she drifted along with it, sensing an expanse so wide that she felt the edges of herself begin to unravel into it. When she awoke, she sensed that they would not have a happy return.

They left the forest and crested a hill to the valley where the horde was encamped. Down below, a figure lying amidst a field of bodies was signing to them to turn back-- that there was no hope. But they couldn't turn back. They could help.

Früt descended the hill and walked through the encampment. To her horror, no chests heaved or shuddered with breath. The stench of festering death filled her nose, her mind, and she felt as if it crawled through her body. She recognized everyone and no one. In death, they both were themselves and were only shells. She tried to find the person who had been waving. Stilling herself and listening, she heard a faint whimper and went toward it, but through searching and searching and digging through the corpses of her horde, she could not find it.

The world went black and she awoke in a mass grave. People she didn't know shoveled dirt on her head, and when she screamed, they screamed back. She was taken to [[Campaign/Encyclopedia/Locations/Xiza\|Xiza]], the refugee camp. There, there were other who had lost all. In the confusion, she had also lost UC. in Xiza, they were all alone, together.
