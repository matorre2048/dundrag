Eryndra Vale is a seasoned healer in her late sixties, her silver hair tied back in a practical braid streaked with traces of its once fiery red. Her deep-set eyes, a piercing gray, carry the weight of countless lives saved and lost. A long scar runs diagonally across her weathered face, a mark of battles both literal and emotional. She moves with a slight limp, but her upright posture and calm demeanor command respect in the crowded refugee camp. Draped in faded robes adorned with symbols of protection, her hands are calloused from years of mixing salves and stitching wounds. Despite her weariness, a quiet but unshakable determination radiates from her, making even the most skeptical bow their heads in her presence. Her voice is firm yet soothing, a balm to the troubled hearts who come seeking her care.
