Rina is a shy, observant orc girl of 13, small for her age with pale green skin and wide amber eyes that seem to absorb everything around her. Orphaned by a devastating magical explosion, she was taken in by the stern but skilled healer Elder Erynda, who raised her with quiet discipline and unspoken care. Often seen clutching Erynda’s walking staff as she assists in tending patients, Rina works diligently to prove herself under her foster mother’s watchful eye. Despite her timid nature, she ventures alone into the Tsobu Forest,
to gather rare herbs, moving through its glowing paths with a quiet ease that few understand. Beneath her reserved exterior lies a resilient spirit, deeply loyal to those she loves and capable of surprising bravery when it matters most.
