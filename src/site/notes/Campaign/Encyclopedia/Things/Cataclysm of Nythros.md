_"The Cataclysm of Nythros was no accident, no freak occurrence of magic gone awry—it was judgment. A reckoning. We have grown complacent, arrogant in our use of magic and defiance of the divine order. The Mourning One, or another god angered by our hubris, sought to remind us of our place."_

Believers in this perspective see the Cataclysm as a divine act meant to punish mortals for their moral and spiritual failings. They cite the chaotic nature of the devastation and the haunting desolation of the _Bleached Expanse_ as evidence of divine wrath. Survivors are seen as either chosen to atone for the sins of the world or as the righteous spared to rebuild a better, holier society.

_"The Cataclysm was not divine judgment, nor was it punishment. It was the failure of mortal ambition and the reckless pursuit of control over forces beyond understanding. Gods had no hand in this; it was our own doing."_

Secular thinkers argue that the Cataclysm was the result of a disastrous magical experiment, likely a ritual or weapon gone catastrophically wrong. This camp often blames powerful nations, rogue mages, or secret cabals for the event, citing the lack of divine intervention or warnings as evidence that this was purely mortal in origin.

Regardless of what people believe, here is what is true:

Unlike an ordinary explosion, the Cataclysm’s effects were eerily random and defied logic. Proximity to the epicenter had no bearing on survival. Entire families vanished without a trace while their neighbors mere feet away remained unharmed. A child playing on a hillside might survive unscathed, while their siblings in the same field crumbled into ash. Even the destruction of structures followed no discernible pattern—some buildings stood intact amidst a sea of rubble, as though the devastation chose its targets arbitrarily. Survivors still speak of the horrifying randomness with a mix of guilt and disbelief, questioning why they were spared when so many others were not.
