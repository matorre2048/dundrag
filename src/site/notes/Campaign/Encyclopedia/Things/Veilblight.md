The Veilblight is a rare and perplexing condition that emerged among survivors of the [[Campaign/Encyclopedia/Things/Cataclysm of Nythros\|Cataclysm of Nythros]] . Tied intrinsically to the chaotic magical energies of the disaster, it leaves its victims marked with strange physical changes and a persistent disruption of magic in their immediate vicinity. While manageable with treatment, the Veilblight is ultimately fatal if left untreated, as it progresses into a toxic condition that affects the blood and vital organs.
