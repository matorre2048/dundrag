Nestled along the fringes of the [[Campaign/Encyclopedia/Locations/Tsobu Forest\|The Arboretum]] and within a day’s travel from the [[Campaign/Encyclopedia/Locations/Xiza\|Refugee Camp]], the Village of Luzwood is a small, resilient community shaped by the proximity of two unique and often intimidating landmarks. While many of its residents are wary of both the forest and the influx of refugees, the village itself has become an essential waypoint for trade, information, and mutual aid in a world still recovering from the Cataclysm.

The villagers are uneasy about the camp’s proximity to the sacred forest, which is said to be watched over by ancient forest spirits. They worry that their diseased could spread from the camp to their villages and that the refugees might try to encroach upon the forest’s edge, risking the wrath of divine entities. Tensions simmer as villagers demand that local leaders address the growing threat, while the refugees are simply struggling to survive, torn between desperation and respect for the forest that looms like a silent guardian at their backs.
