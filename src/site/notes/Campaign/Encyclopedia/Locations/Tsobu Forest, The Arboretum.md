The divine forest is a hauntingly beautiful, mist-drenched expanse where every tree, rock, and stream seems steeped in ancient magic. Towering trees, cloaked in thick moss and vines, rise into the mist like cathedral pillars, their massive roots tangling and twisting across the forest floor. The canopy, dense and woven with hanging vines and strange blooms, filters the sunlight into pale green shafts that dance with drifting particles, giving the air a shimmering, ethereal quality. The forest floor is soft with layers of fallen leaves and moss, while deep pools and winding streams reflect fractured light in patches.

Hidden in the depths of the forest, there are said to be rare fruits with vibrant colors that catch the eye—pale silver, deep crimson, or a glowing blue. Locals believe these fruits can cure nearly any illness if picked under the right conditions, but gathering them is no simple task. The forest is fiercely protective, often shifting paths, conjuring thick fog, or even whispering warnings to intruders who approach with ill intentions. Legends claim that a giant tortoise spirit, or perhaps even a divine god in tortoise form, watches over the forest, an ancient guardian that roams the woods slowly but with purpose.

The villagers, who consider the forest sacred, share stories of glimpsing a shadowed shell the size of a boulder through the mist, or of hearing a deep, rumbling sigh from within the forest’s heart. Offerings are left by the town at the forest’s edge—flowers, fruits, and carved wooden figures—to honor and appease this spirit. Those who enter with respect and humility may find their way safely through, while those who seek to exploit the forest’s magic often find themselves lost in a maze of unending trees, only sometimes to emerge days later, empty-handed and disoriented, with a new respect for the power that guards the heart of this mystical woodland. 

In the refugee camp, the Tsobu Forest is revered as a sacred, almost holy place. To the orcs and other displaced people living there, the forest represents hope and healing; they believe that every mist-laden branch, every bloom, and even the thick undergrowth carries the blessings of Genba, the ancient tortoise spirit. Many in the camp leave handmade offerings at the forest’s edge, such as woven grasses, carved stones, or symbolic tokens, seeking protection or recovery from illness. They speak in whispers about the forest, mindful not to disturb its peace and viewing it as a place that must be approached with reverence and humility.

The villagers, however, see the forest as more of a valuable natural reserve. They respect its beauty and bounty, appreciating its rare herbs, medicinal fruits, and spiritual significance, but they approach it with a sense of ownership and practical care, treating it almost like an arboretum. Their understanding of the forest is rooted in tradition, but they believe its wonders are there to be carefully managed and harvested. They often send foragers and herbalists into the forest with baskets and trimming tools, viewing it less as a divine presence and more as a resource to be maintained for the good of their community. This difference in perspective has created an unspoken tension, as the refugees and villagers each hold their own interpretation of how the forest—and its legendary protector—should be treated.
