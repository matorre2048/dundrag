The refugee camp sits on the rugged, mist-laden edge of an ancient divine forest, where towering trees form a natural barrier to the sacred woods within. Makeshift tents and crude shelters, mostly constructed from scavenged materials and salvaged lumber, form a sprawling patchwork over the uneven ground. The camp is home to a weary population of orcs displaced by distant wars, but a few elves, humans, and goblins have also found refuge here. 

Life in the camp is hard, with limited resources and a lack of clean water. Smoke rises constantly from cookfires and smithing areas, giving the air a pungent, metallic smell. Despite their efforts, the inhabitants struggle with outbreaks of disease due to overcrowding and poor sanitation. Food supplies are scarce, and hunting in the divine forest is forbidden, leaving the refugees in a constant state of near-starvation.
