#### Sorcerer Class Features
###### Level 1: Spellcasting
Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the Sorcerer spell list later in the class's description.
   ***Cantrips.*** You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. *Light, Prestidigitation, shocking* 
*grasp,* and *Sorcerous Burst* are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.
   When you reach Sorcerer level 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your
choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.
   ***Spell Slots.*** The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.
   ***Prepared Spells of Level 1+***. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you 
to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. *Burning Hands* and *Detect Magic* are recommended.
   The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the 
Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
   If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells 
don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.
   Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one 
spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.
   ***Spellcasting Ability.*** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.
   ***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer 
spells.
#### Barbarian Subclasses

##### Clockwork Sorcery
*Channel Cosmic Forces of Order*
The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a realm like it- a plane of existence shaped entirely by clock-work efficiency. You or someone from your lineage might have become entangled in the machinations of modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March. What ever its origin within you, the power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it's part of a vast and glorious system. 
Level 3: Clockwork Spells

| Sorcerer Level | Spells                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3              | Aid, Alarm, Lesser Restoration, Protection from Evil and Good |
| 5              | Dlspel Magic, Protection from Energy                          |
| 7              | Freedom of Movement, Summon Construct                         |
| 9              | Greater Restoration, Wall of Force                            |
In addition, consult the Manifestations of Order table and choose or randomly determine a way your connection to order manifests while you are casting any of your Sorcerer spells.
